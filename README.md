## Background
This project aims to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various supervised learning algorithms in accurately classifying breast cancer as malignant or benign, using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The study will assess the performance of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network algorithms based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. However, it should be noted that the study is limited to the dataset's features, and other risk factors or clinical information may impact breast cancer diagnosis. Additionally, the chosen algorithms may not be the most optimal for this task.

## Research Question
Among the various supervised learning algorithms evaluated in this study using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which one performed the most effectively in accurately classifying breast cancer as malignant or benign?

## Methods

### MACHINE LEARNING ANALYSIS TO BE PERFORMED
Diagnosis of breast masses as benign or malignant: Machine learning analysis will be performed on this dataset to build a predictive model that can distinguish between benign and malignant breast masses.

5 Supervised learning and 1 unsupervised learning models will be compared to identified that most optimum algorithm for this data set.

### Supervised learning algorithms to explore are:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Neural Network

### Unupervised learning algorithms to explore are:
  - K-Nearest-Neighbour (KNN)

### Diagnosis of breast masses ( benign or malignant)
The problem of diagnosing breast cancer as malignant or benign is a binary classification problem, as there are only two possible outcomes. Therefore, we can build a binary classification model using supervised learning algorithms.
