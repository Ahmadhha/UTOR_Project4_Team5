## Background
This project aims to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various supervised learning algorithms in accurately classifying breast cancer as malignant or benign, using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The study will assess the performance of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network algorithms based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. However, it should be noted that the study is limited to the dataset's features, and other risk factors or clinical information may impact breast cancer diagnosis. Additionally, the chosen algorithms may not be the most optimal for this task.

## Research Question
Which supervised learning algorithm performs the best in diagnosing breast cancer as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset?
